i have made this project but now, i want to remake it, trying to use ReactJs for frontend and NodeJS for backend and using MSSQL for database. So, i need you to help me convert this project to that version
requirements:
make two folders, one for frontend and one for backend
make a database using mssql to store the information of accounts, products (in initialization.js) (i dont know how to store images in mssql, so you can use a link to store the image)

you can add more files if you needed

guide me to create the project and show me the project folder structure
